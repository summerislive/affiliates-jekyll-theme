Denver, Colorado is the perfect blend of city and nature and definitely one of my favorite places in the US. Only a quick plane ride away, Denver made for the perfect quick Summer getaway. I spent 4 days in Denver and have compiled my favorite activities, best travel tips and most loved restaurants in this blog.
Whether you enjoy the outdoors, love shopping, or just want to eat until your heart's content, Denver has something for yah!

**Traveling to and from Denver:**
Roundtrip Flights from Los Angeles to Denver start as low as $45 to about $250 depending on the dates you select. In my most recent trip, I got to fly for **FREE** thanks to my Chase Credit Card points (yaaaas highly recommend) My ticket came out to $150 or 25,000 points. 

**Traveling in Denver:**
I decided not to rent a car during this trip and planned my hotel location accordingly.
- Ubers are readily available and quite affordable, although you may need to wait out the peak hours as prices may surge.
- Lime and Lyft scooters are scattered all over the city and are quite cheap. I highly recommend this option for solo travelers as it will be cheaper than Uber. Take note that you are not supposed to scooter on the sidewalk so it can be a little intimidating to be cruising next to the cars on the road especially if you don't have a helmet with you.
- Take advantage of the **Free Mall Bus!** This electric bus starts at Union Station and drives all the way down 16 street to the Civic Center Station and back. Hope on and off as many times as you want and explore the city!

**Where to Stay:**

Perfectly situated in the city lies **Hotel Teatro**, a charming Renaissance Revival building over 100 years old! Talk about immersing yourself in history It is walking distance from Larimer Square and only two blocks away from the Denver Convention Center. The Four Seasons is directly across the street and there are plenty of food options nearby. A 7-Eleven is one block down if you forget any of your necessities.

**Amenities:** Free Bikes, Courtesy Vehicle Service (unavailable due to covid), Gym

**Restaurant:** The Nickel

I only had the chance to eat breakfast at The Nickel, but it was delicious! There silver dollar pancakes are fluffy and crispy on the outside. Served with syrup AND watermelon jam!

**Things You Have to Do:**

**1. Denver Botanical Gardens**

My trip was short, but it gave me the perfect glimpse into this beautiful city. I will definitely be coming back to snowboard and hopefully I can conquer one of the fourteen-ers. If you have any questions feel free to send me a DM on any of my socials. Thanks for reading!
