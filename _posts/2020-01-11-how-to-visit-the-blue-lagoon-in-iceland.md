Research will be your best friend while navigating through the do's and dont's of visiting this major attraction. Compiled below are the important facts, tips, photo spots, and secrets you **need** to know in order to have the most magical experience in Iceland's Blue Lagoon.

## Fun Facts:

### **What is it?**

The Blue Lagoon is a man-made geothermal pool. It also happens to be the largest in the world!

### **How does it work?**

High temperature water is released from the ground where there is lava flow. The water is used to power the turbines that generate electricity and then the steam and hot water pass through a heat exchanger. Iceland is able to give locals hot water and use nature and technology together to provide sustainable energy!! You go Iceland!

### **Where is it located?**

It is in the southwestern part of Iceland, 45 minutes outside of Reykjavic away **20 minutes** away from Keflavik Airport. The Blue Lagoon was actually my final stop in Iceland. I enjoyed the spa in the morning and headed over to the airport for my flight out at 4PM.

### **How hot does it get?**

The water in the lagoon averages about 99–102 °F (37–39 °C). It will be freezing as soon as you get out of the lagoon, so brace yourselves and get to your robes quickly!

### **What is in the water?**

The geothermal water is cloudy and saturated with minerals, silica and algae. If you put the water in a glass it actually appears white and milky, but it looks blue because of the silica! Don't bother bringing goggles either because you won't see anything underwater.

### How much does it cost?:

Depending on your budget there are different packages to choose from. Note that the conversion rates below are estimates, see this [link](https://www.bluelagoon.com/explore) for current pricing.

## 7 Important TIPS:

### 1. Hair care

The most important advice I can give to you is to **take care of your hair**. The minerals in the water will damage your hair and if you do not take the necessary precautions, your hair will come out looking like a bird's nest. My poor cousin ended up having to chop of inches of her hair just to get rid of the tangles. Use the conditioner provided by Blue Lagoon and massage it through your hair like your life depends on it, because it does. Personally, I tied up my hair into a bun and avoided dipping it into the water, but if you're feeling adventurous I recommend lathering your hair in conditioner multiple times before and after! Do not rinse it off, just keep it lathered onto your hair when you enter the lagoon!

### 2. Pre-book your visit

Purchase your tickets in advance and schedule a time that works for you. As one of the biggest tourist destinations in Iceland, you'll want to make sure that the date you have planned is available! Tickets will also be slightly cheaper if purchased in advance as opposed to walk-ins. Entrance times are scheduled every hour starting at 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

### 3. Bring Children, They're free

This is probably the only occasion where you bring your kids to the spa with you, but what the the heck! Children ages 2-13 years old don't have to pay an entrance fee! Sounds like the perfect field trip to me!

### 4. Water Proof Your Electronic Devices

I've heard the horror stories of people losing their phones on their trip to the Blue Lagoon. You don't want to be that person. Bring waterproof cases and waterproof bags with you or just leave your electronics in the lockers.

### 5. Visit Blue lagoon When Going/Coming from Airport

The location of Blue Lagoon is ideal as your first/last destination en route to and from the airport. I enjoyed making it my last stop, as I was fully relaxed in time for my flight!

### 6. Use the Lockers to store your things

Your electronic wristbands are very important as you will use it to purchase things as well as open your locker. The locker rooms are where you will store all of your things including your shoes, clothes, toiletries, electronics, etc. You'll want to bring slippers and a towel/robe with you which you can leaves on hooks provided by the lagoon! It will be pretty cold as you hop out of the lagoon, so exit close to your towel!

### 7. Shower before you Swim...butt naked

Locker rooms are separated by gender and yes, you will have to shower butt naked before entering the lagoon. My family had a good laugh about this as most of us were not used to being completely naked in front of strangers. This is a hygiene requirement and actually for the best! Don't forget to condition your hair!

### 8. OTher THINGS you can do in the lagoon

- Get a mud mask.
- Enjoy a Drink.
- Take a lot of pictures.
- Relax.

### **9. Secret Photo Spot aka. BEST Viewing Deck**

Not a lot of people know about this spot. If you want the best view of the lagoon head towards the restaurant and go upstairs to the second floor.

### Additional Info:

The Lava Restaurant serves food and there is a cafe located by the entrance. I didn't get to try the food, but it looked tasty! Blue Lagoon Skin care products are also available for purchase at their store.
